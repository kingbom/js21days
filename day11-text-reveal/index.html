            <h2>Bangkok City</h2>
            <p>
                Bangkok city is one of the places in Thailand that never fails to amused me even after visiting this particular for more than a hundred times for the last 7 years.
                Whether you choose to ride the BTS or the local buses. Every corner of this city always has an amazing story to tell.
                I love travelling on the local buses the most if you do not mind the traffic.
                For a small amount of money you can take the city bus without air-conditioning,
                take the opportunity to snap a few shoots during the heavy traffic.
                A good way to experience the city culture. In the night, Bangkok is a city just like New York...never sleeps.
                The traffic by the night would be much better compared to the day. Take a walk on the busy streets of Silom.
                You will find stalls selling local merchandises and some local street food. And of course,
                when you come to Silom you must visit one of their bars. You will definately be fascinated and amazed by one of them.
                To end the night, why not sit at one the pubs and enjoy some live band music with a mug of reasonably priced beer.
                Lets take a walk again tomorrow

            <h2>“BANGKOK..." city of angels"...some interesting sites”</h2>
            <p>
                BANGKOK, means, City of Angels, and was established in 1782 by King Rama I as capital of Siam.
                it has a population of over 6 million people...although a booming metropolis, it has retained much of its traditional charm...it is a mixture of East and West,
                the ancient and the modern...on the surface it is like many cities of the east, while underneath,
                the old ways are much alive...a great way to tour the city is on the river as i have found after three trips to this city...and experiencing the motor bikes, cars,
                and smog of this beautiful part of the world...the river is bustling for sure but you can see all the best sites by public boat taxi and you can go and get off
                where you like for pennies...here are few i would recommend...1. Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaen..Temple of the Emerald Buddha....The Grand Palace,
                is famous for its impressive buildings. Wat Phra Kaen is renowned as the most beautiful temple in Thailand. it houses Phra Kaeo Morakot,
                the most highly revered Buddha image carved from a single block of fine jade, and was brought to Bangkok, from, Chiang Rai,
                a province to the north. it is so richly and intricately decorated that once entering the temple, you feel you have entered
